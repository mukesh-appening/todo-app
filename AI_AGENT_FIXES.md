# AI Agent Button Stability Fixes

## Problem

The "Add Task" button was experiencing stability issues during automated testing with AI agents. The button had continuous pulse animations that caused it to constantly change size and appearance, making it unstable for automated clicking.

## Root Cause

- The `AddButton` component had a pulse animation (`pulseAnimation`) that ran continuously when there were no tasks (`animate={tasks.length === 0}`)
- The animation caused the button to constantly scale and change box-shadow, making it unstable for AI agents
- Playwright/AI agents require stable elements to successfully interact with them

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Test Mode Detection

- Created `src/utils/testMode.ts` with utility functions to detect test environments
- Detects HeadlessChrome, Playwright, Puppeteer, and test NODE_ENV
- Provides `isTestMode()` function for consistent detection

### 2. Button Stability Improvements

- Added `testMode` prop to `AddButton` styled component
- When `testMode` is true, all animations and transitions are disabled
- Added explicit stability properties:
  - `animation: none !important`
  - `transition: none !important`
  - `transform: none !important`
  - `will-change: auto !important`
  - `opacity: 1 !important`
  - `visibility: visible !important`
  - `pointer-events: auto !important`

### 3. Global Test Mode Support

- Added global CSS rules in `globalStyles.tsx` to disable animations system-wide in test mode
- Automatic detection and application of test mode styles
- Added `.test-mode` class for manual test mode activation

### 4. Mobile Button Fixes

- Applied same stability fixes to mobile `AddIconContainer` in `BottomNav.tsx`
- Ensures both desktop and mobile add buttons are stable for testing

### 5. Test Selectors

- Added `data-testid="add-task-button"` for desktop version
- Added `data-testid="add-task-button-mobile"` for mobile version
- Improved accessibility with proper `aria-label` attributes

### 6. Automatic Initialization

- Created `useTestMode` hook that automatically enables test mode on app start
- Integrated into main `App.tsx` component

## Files Modified

- `src/styles/home.styled.tsx` - Desktop AddButton stability
- `src/components/BottomNav.tsx` - Mobile AddButton stability
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Button usage with test mode
- `src/styles/globalStyles.tsx` - Global test mode styles
- `src/utils/testMode.ts` - Test mode utilities (new)
- `src/hooks/useTestMode.ts` - Test mode hook (new)
- `src/App.tsx` - Test mode initialization

## Testing

The button should now be stable for AI agents and automated testing tools. The animations are completely disabled in test environments while maintaining the user experience in normal usage.

## Usage for AI Agents

AI agents can now reliably:

- Find the button using `data-testid="add-task-button"` or `data-testid="add-task-button-mobile"`
- Click the button without stability issues
- Interact with the button consistently across different test scenarios
