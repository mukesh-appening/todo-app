## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial curiosity ‚áí mild concern (small / low-contrast UI). Rapid frustration when key features (install prompt, dark mode toggle, file-upload, Add-Task click) fail. Confidence briefly recovers during successful task-completion flow, but overall impression ends mixed-negative: app feels unreliable and visually unpolished.

| **Critical controls not found or unclickable (install prompt, dark-mode toggle, Add-Task, JSON upload)** | Blocks users from core functions; leads to abandonment.                                                 | ‚Ä¢ Verify elements are rendered and in DOM on all viewports.<br>‚Ä¢ Remove overlapping labels/divs that intercept clicks.<br>‚Ä¢ Increase click target sizes & stability (avoid animations on mount).<br>‚Ä¢ Provide fallback in-app buttons when browser PWA prompt is absent. |
| **Visual hierarchy & readability (colour contrast, typography, button size)**                            | Poor legibility and unclear hierarchy reduce usability and perceived quality, especially accessibility. | ‚Ä¢ Audit colour palette against WCAG AA; adjust foreground/background contrast.<br>‚Ä¢ Standardise font sizes, weights, heading styles via design tokens.<br>‚Ä¢ Adopt consistent button component with adequate padding/min width.                                           |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix click-blocking overlays for ‚ÄòSelect JSON File‚Äô & ‚ÄòAdd Task‚Äô buttons (CSS pointer-events / z-index).**

3. **Increase text/background contrast to meet WCAG AA across app (quick stylesheet tweak).**
4. **Add in-app PWA install button as fallback when browser prompt fails.**
