## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial curiosity turns into mild visual unease (inconsistent spacing/typography). Confidence drops sharply when the form shows no validation feedback and the user is blocked from proceeding. Visiting the homepage feels barren (empty-state) and frustrating when the checkbox to complete a task is invisible. Overall sentiment shifts from hopeful to confused, then to frustrated and mistrustful of the app’s reliability.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                                                                              | Status     | Details                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task Creation Flow – Step 1: Open task-creation URL                               | ✅ pass    | Page loads, but UI review flags inconsistent typography, label alignment and padding.                                                                     |
| Task Creation Flow – Step 2: Form fields visible                                  | ✅ pass    | All expected inputs (Task Name, Description, Deadline, Category) are present.; UI still shows spacing / button-style inconsistencies.                     |
| Task Creation Flow – Step 3: Submit empty form                                    | ❌ fail    | Automated test times out waiting for required-field error ‘Task Name \* is required’.; No helper-text element found → validation errors not rendered.     |
| Task Creation Flow – Steps 4-12                                                   | ❌ pending | Remainder of journey blocked because validation did not fire; user cannot continue to add emoji, colour, deadline, category or save task.                 |
| Task Completion & Progress Tracking – Step 1: Open homepage                       | ✅ pass    | Home loads, minor alignment issue noted (no tasks present to fully assess).                                                                               |
| Task Completion & Progress Tracking – Step 2: Identify incomplete task            | ✅ pass    | Screenshot captured, but still no forms visible; likely empty-state.                                                                                      |
| Task Completion & Progress Tracking – Step 3: Tick checkbox to mark task complete | ❌ fail    | Automation cannot find checkbox control → element either missing from DOM or not discoverable.; Stops flow; progress-bar and badge checks never executed. |
| Task Completion & Progress Tracking – Steps 4-8                                   | ❌ pending | Blocked due to missing checkbox.                                                                                                                          |
| Task Sharing & Import – Step 1: Open homepage                                     | ✅ pass    | Page loads with typography and margin inconsistencies noted.                                                                                              |
| Task Sharing & Import – Steps 2-9                                                 | ❌ pending | Flow still running; no failures yet but dependent on earlier ability to create/select a task.                                                             |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                         | Why It Matters                                                                                                                         | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Validation feedback & error handling**                     | Users rely on immediate, clear guidance to correct mistakes. Silent failures make the product feel broken and prevent task completion. | • Render helper-text elements for all required fields; ensure aria-describedby ties inputs to messages for accessibility.<br>• Add unit tests for presence of error text on empty submit.<br>• Use consistent wording and styling (e.g. red text, icon) across all errors. |
| **Control discoverability (checkbox, share icons, buttons)** | If interactive elements are not visible or affordances are weak, users cannot complete core flows (mark done, share).                  | • Verify that task items render a checkbox input with clear hit-area on all breakpoints.<br>• Add hover / focus states and label text to reinforce purpose.<br>• Include share icon in the task card with tooltip text; ensure it is present in DOM.                       |
| **Empty-state & first-run experience**                       | Landing on an empty list without guidance leaves users uncertain what to do next and hides key UI that tests later expect.             | • Design an empty-state illustration plus copy explaining how to add a task.<br>• Surface the ‘Add Task’ CTA prominently even when list is empty.                                                                                                                          |
| **Visual consistency (typography, spacing, buttons)**        | Inconsistent visuals reduce perceived quality and can imply broken functionality.                                                      | • Establish design tokens for font sizes, weights, spacing and reuse via CSS/Theme.<br>• Audit margins/padding in form vs. list views; adjust to 8-pt grid.<br>• Standardise button styles (height, border-radius, colour) in shared component library.                    |
| **Progress & feedback after actions**                        | Users need immediate reassurance that their action (task completed, task shared) succeeded.                                            | • Ensure progress bar increments visually on task completion; update badge counter in real time.<br>• Add subtle toast notification confirming ‘Task marked as done’ or ‘Link copied’.<br>• Write automated UI tests for these state changes.                              |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix required-field validation so error messages render instantly on empty submit.**
2. **Make task checkbox element visible & accessible on all list items (key blocker to completion flow).**
3. **Provide an informative empty-state with a clear ‘Add Task’ button to guide new users.**
4. **Apply a quick CSS pass to normalise typography sizes and 8-pt spacing; low effort but high perceived polish.**
5. **Add real-time feedback (toast or badge update) when a task state changes to reinforce success.**
