## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts with mild optimism (clean empty state) → grows into frustration as small layout issues pile up → reaches high frustration when critical actions (‘Create Task’, ‘Add Category’, PWA install) silently fail or give no feedback → partial relief when some actions work (edit, theme change) but confidence never fully recovers.

| Launch & land on dashboard                                                         | ✅ pass    | Every scenario begins by opening http://localhost:5173 and landing on an empty/initial dashboard.; Visual QA repeatedly flags mis-aligned elements and inconsistent typography as early as the landing page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Try to add a new task                                                              | ❌ mixed   | User opens the “Add Task” modal and fills in Name, Description, Deadline, Category and Emoji.; In Drag & Move Task the flow breaks – the Create Task button is clickable but a still-open categories pop-over intercepts the click (hard FAILURE).; Other ‘Add Task’ tests eventually succeed but testers note missing success toast or list refresh, so users are left guessing whether the task was really added.                                                               |
| Manipulate existing tasks (move, complete, pin, view details, edit, delete, purge) | ❌ mixed   | Moving a task fails early because the previous hard failure left no task to move (cascade).; Mark-as-done / Mark-as-not-done works but no in-app confirmation banner appears; testers rely on visual strike-through only.; Pinning, editing and deleting technically work yet many verification steps remain ‘pending’ because UI feedback is subtle or absent.; ‘Purge all tasks’ succeeds, but multiple spelling errors (‘taks’) and no pre-delete warning copy diminish trust. |
| Manage categories                                                                  | ❌ mixed   | Editing and favouriting categories succeed, but UI chrome (star icons, colour pickers) looks inconsistent and lacks spacing.; Adding a brand-new category (‘Hobby’) fails – form submits but list never updates (hard FAILURE).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Change appearance settings                                                         | ❌ partial | Theme toggles (Light / Dark / System) work, but ‘Auto’ and ‘Reduce Motion > System’ remain in pending state – testers could not prove behaviour.; Glow effect toggle lacks obvious visual feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Attempt to install the PWA                                                         | ❌ fail    | Safari tester cannot find any ‘Install App’ affordance; all subsequent steps (launch, offline check) fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                            | Why It Matters                                                                                                                 | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Action feedback & confirmations**             | Without visible toasts or list refresh, users are unsure if their action succeeded, leading to repeated clicks or abandonment. | • Add success/failure toast for Create, Edit, Delete, Pin, Purge, Category add.<br>• Auto-close modals and refresh lists after successful mutation.<br>• Provide non-blocking loading spinners when network call in flight.                                                          |
| **Interactive overlay management**              | Open pop-overs (category menu) block clicks on underlying buttons, causing hard test and user failures.                        | • Auto-close pop-overs when user clicks outside them.<br>• Disable underlying CTA while overlay is open (or move it above z-layer).<br>• Write integration test reproducing the intercepted click bug.                                                                               |
| **Visual consistency (type, spacing, buttons)** | Inconsistent fonts, padding and button styles erode brand trust and make UI feel unfinished.                                   | • Adopt a design-token scale for typography and spacing and apply via global style sheet.<br>• Run a one-time pass with linters / style-lint to normalise margins and paddings.<br>• Audit all buttons for size, border-radius, colour and hover state; convert to shared component. |
| **Copy quality & accessibility**                | Misspellings (‘taks’), unclear hierarchy and low-contrast colours hurt credibility and accessibility compliance.               | • Pass all static copy through spell-checker; add i18n strings to catch future typos.<br>• Meet WCAG AA colour-contrast for text on backgrounds.<br>• Use semantic headings (<h1-h3>) to establish hierarchy.                                                                        |
| **Task & category creation reliability**        | Core data-entry flows occasionally fail (category not persisted, task not added) – a show-stopper for productivity app.        | • Add front-end form validation and disable Submit until required fields valid.<br>• Return server error details to UI and display them inside modal.<br>• Add e2e test that asserts new item appears in list after POST.                                                            |
| **PWA installability**                          | Promised ‘Install App’ feature missing confuses users and testers, and blocks offline use goal.                                | • Add PWA manifest & service-worker; serve over https; include display: standalone & install prompt handler.<br>• Show ‘Install’ option in in-app menu when criteria met; hide otherwise to avoid dead ends.<br>• Document install steps for each browser.                           |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix overlay-intercepts-CTA bug on Create Task (close dropdown or raise z-index). This unblocks primary flow.**
2. **Add toast/snackbar confirmations for all CRUD actions so users instantly know the result.**
3. **Run spell-check and correct visible typos (‘taks’, ‘Catgeory’) to improve perceived quality in minutes.**
4. **Standardise button component and apply uniform padding/margin classes – quick CSS refactor with high visual payoff.**
5. **Expose or remove the ‘Install App’ option until PWA criteria are fully met to avoid confusion.**
