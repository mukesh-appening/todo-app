### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                                 | Status        | Details                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch application                   | ‚úÖ pass       | All tests start by navigating to http://localhost:5173 without issue.                                                                                                        |
| Open ‚ÄúAdd Task‚Äù modal                | ‚úÖ pass       | User clicks + / Add-Task button on dashboard. Modal appears. Minor UI issues (button style, typography).                                                                     |
| Fill in task fields                  | ‚úÖ pass       | Name, description, deadline, category, color and emoji are entered. Recurrent layout problems: label alignment, uneven padding, inconsistent fonts.                          |
| Submit task via ‚ÄúCreate Task‚Äù button | ‚ùå fail       | Critical in Drag-and-Move flow: drop-down menu (category list) stays open and intercepts the click. Playwright times out after multiple retries.                             |
| Observe success feedback             | ‚ùå mixed      | In several flows user sees task appear in list, but there is never an explicit toast/alert. In Mark-as-Not-Done test the absence of a confirmation message causes a failure. |
| Re-order / Drag task                 | ‚ùå blocked    | Not reached because task creation failed earlier.                                                                                                                            |
| Mark task as done / not done         | ‚ùå partial    | Mark-as-Done flow works; reverting to ‚Äònot done‚Äô works visually but again no confirmation message ‚Üí test fails.                                                              |
| Pin task                             | ‚ùå partial    | User can open menu and select Pin, but final verification of icon placement/screenshot is pending ‚Äî likely unclear visual cue of pinned state.                               |
| View task details                    | ‚úÖ pass       | Three-dot menu ‚Üí Task details modal opens and shows information. UI inside modal still suffers from spacing & label alignment issues.                                        |
| Edit task                            | ‚ùå incomplete | Test stalled: three-dot menu for Edit never triggered; subsequent edit, save and verification steps pending.                                                                 |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                  | Why It Matters                                                                                                  | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interactive overlays & z-index**                    | Blocking overlays prevent primary actions (e.g., category menu intercepting Create Task) causing hard failures. | ‚Ä¢ Auto-close category/menu popovers on selection or when losing focus.<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure popovers have lower z-index than primary modal action buttons.<br>‚Ä¢ Add E2E test that asserts Create-Task button is clickable after selection. |
| **Feedback & confirmation**                           | Users need reassurance that actions succeeded; tests fail when no toast/alert is shown.                         | ‚Ä¢ Add toast or snackbar for task created / updated / status changed.<br>‚Ä¢ Include subtle animation (e.g., list item slide-in) to show list update.<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure ARIA live-region so screen-reader users get the feedback.          |
| **Visual consistency (typography, spacing, buttons)** | Inconsistent hierarchy and cramped spacing make the app feel unreliable and hurt scan-ability.                  | ‚Ä¢ Define design tokens (font sizes, weights, padding) and reuse via theme.<br>‚Ä¢ Audit all buttons for size, shape, color; apply single component.<br>‚Ä¢ Use auto-layout or CSS grid to keep labels and inputs aligned.             |
| **Accessibility & color usage**                       | Low contrast and vibrant, non-brand colors reduce readability and may exclude users.                            | ‚Ä¢ Run automated contrast checks; adjust palette to meet WCAG AA.<br>‚Ä¢ Reserve accent colors for interactive elements; keep backgrounds calm.<br>‚Ä¢ Add focus states to all interactive controls.                                   |
| **State indicators (Pinned, Done)**                   | Users (and tests) struggle to see when a task is pinned or completed.                                           | ‚Ä¢ Introduce clear icons/badges for pinned, done, overdue.<br>‚Ä¢ Place pinned tasks in a dedicated section or sticky top list.<br>‚Ä¢ Update checklist style (strikethrough + faded color) for completed tasks.                       |
| **Modal usability & scroll**                          | Long forms require excessive scrolling; users lose context.                                                     | ‚Ä¢ Group optional fields under expandable section.<br>‚Ä¢ Keep primary actions (Create/Save) fixed at bottom of viewport.<br>‚Ä¢ Validate required fields and disable Create until valid.                                              |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix category popover so it closes on selection and does not obstruct the Create Task button.**
2. **Add toast/snackbar confirmations for create, update, pin/unpin, done/undone actions.**
3. **Standardise button component (size, color, padding) across dashboard and modals.**
4. **Introduce clear visual badge/icon for pinned and completed states.**
5. **Apply consistent spacing & label alignment in Add/Edit Task modal using a CSS utility scale.**
