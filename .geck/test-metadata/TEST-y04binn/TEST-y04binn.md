## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> The session starts with mild optimism‚Äî the dashboard loads quickly and the Add-Task modal appears. Confidence fades into irritation as visual inconsistencies pile up. Frustration spikes when Create-Task and Date-picker actions fail repeatedly (they look clickable but do nothing). Momentum is lost; user feels stuck, uncertain whether data is saved. In the one successful flow, relief arrives, but lingering UI rough edges prevent delight.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                                                  | Status     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Launch & land on dashboard                            | ‚úÖ pass    | All runs successfully reached http://localhost:5173.; Minor UI warnings surfaced (inconsistent typography, padding).                                                                                                                                        |

| Extended task operations (drag, pin, mark done, etc.) | ‚ùå pending | All downstream interactions are skipped because task creation never completes.                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                        | Why It Matters                                                                                                            | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Form overlays & click interception**                      | Users cannot finish a task when hidden overlays (category menu) sit above primary CTAs ‚Äî leading to dead-end frustration. | ‚Ä¢ Auto-close dropdown/onBlur when an option is chosen.<br>‚Ä¢ Raise z-index of modal footer OR lower z-index of popover so it never covers the footer area.<br>‚Ä¢ Add E2E test that asserts Create-Task button is clickable after category selection.         |
| **Date-picker focus & accessibility**                       | Endless retry loop signals the date field is either off-screen, disabled, or lacks focus management, blocking progress.   | ‚Ä¢ Ensure the input receives focus and opens the picker on click and keyboard.<br>‚Ä¢ Add visible affordance (calendar icon) with aria-label.<br>‚Ä¢ Write unit test for opening/closing date-picker.                                                           |
| **Field discoverability & selector stability**              | Failure to locate ‚ÄúTask Name‚Äù suggests dynamic IDs or conditional rendering that QA & assistive tech can‚Äôt find.          | ‚Ä¢ Use stable data-testids / aria-labels on all fields.<br>‚Ä¢ Render modal fields immediately (then disable if needed) to keep selectors constant.<br>‚Ä¢ Add empty-state placeholder text so humans can spot fields quickly.                                  |
| **Visual consistency (typography, spacing, button styles)** | Repeated ‚Äúlooks off‚Äù flags erode brand trust and make the layout feel unfinished.                                         | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a global typographic scale (e.g., 16/20/24 px).<br>‚Ä¢ Define spacing tokens (8-pt grid) and use in MUI theme.<br>‚Ä¢ Audit button variants; reduce to primary / secondary with fixed sizes.<br>‚Ä¢ Run automated visual regression after theme changes. |
| **Color contrast & theme adherence**                        | Low contrast harms accessibility and may breach WCAG AA; brand colors feel inconsistent.                                  | ‚Ä¢ Re-evaluate palette in Figma; pair each brand color with an accessible contrast fallback.<br>‚Ä¢ Expose category colors in a fixed grid rather than free-form to control contrast.<br>‚Ä¢ Add storybook a11y addon to flag contrast issues early.            |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Close or lower z-index of Category dropdown automatically so ‚ÄúCreate Task‚Äù is never obstructed.**
2. **Stabilize Date-picker click/focus behaviour and add a visible calendar icon.**
3. **Add consistent data-testids & aria-labels to all modal fields to prevent selector failures.**
4. **Apply a base type scale and 8-pt spacing tokens in the global MUI theme for instant visual polish.**
5. **Introduce automated a11y/contrast checks in CI to catch color issues early.**
