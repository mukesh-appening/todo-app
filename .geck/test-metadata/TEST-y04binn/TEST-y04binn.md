## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts with moderate confidence – site loads quickly. Confidence dips when UI looks visually ‘off’ (low contrast, misaligned labels). In test 1, frustration spikes immediately when the Add Task button doesn’t respond. In test 2, optimism returns as fields can be filled, but lingering sloppiness (spacing, missing labels) creates distrust. Failure to find the Color section abruptly blocks progress, leaving the shopper confused and disappointed.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Launch the app (both tests) | ✅ pass | Browser successfully loads http://localhost:5173.; Minor UI issues flagged: low text/background contrast and missing form inputs in the viewport. |
| 2. Click “Add Task” button | ❌ fail (TEST-8x4rv1e) / pass (TEST-y04binn) | TEST-8x4rv1e: Button located but never reached a stable state – Playwright timed out.; TEST-y04binn: Button clicked after ~144 s (long for a simple tap). UI checker still notes label–input mis-alignment. |
| 3. Wait for ‘Add New Task’ modal | ❌ pass (TEST-y04binn) | Modal appears, but spacing/padding is uneven and several labels don’t line up with inputs. |
| 4-7. Fill out Task fields (Name, Description, Deadline, Categories) | ❌ pass (TEST-y04binn) | All text inputs accept data, but auto-validation retried the date field twice.; UI review keeps flagging label alignment issues and missing labels (‘Select Categories’, ‘Task Deadline’). |
| 8. Choose a color | ❌ fail (TEST-y04binn) | Automation cannot find a ‘Color’ section at all; user would be stuck or forced to skip color choice. |
| 9-17. Emoji pick, submit task, mark done, screenshot | ❌ not executed / pending | Both test runs halt after the color-picker failure, so the flow never reaches submission or completion states. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Element stability & clickability (Add Task button)** | If primary CTA is intermittently unclickable, users feel the app is broken and abandon quickly. | • Remove entrance/hover animations until the element is fully mounted OR wait for transitionend before enabling clicks.<br>• Ensure size/position is not shifting in the DOM after initial render. |
| **Visibility & alignment of form labels/inputs** | Misaligned or missing labels hurt comprehension, accessibility (screen readers), and data-entry speed. | • Audit every field in the modal; pair each input with a <label> and consistent grid/stack layout.<br>• Run automated a11y tests for label-input association.<br>• Add CSS rules for consistent left alignment and equal spacing. |
| **Missing Color section / Color picker discoverability** | Feature advertised in UI text but not present causes dead ends and undermines trust. | • Confirm component is mounted in DOM; if hidden behind accordion/tab, default it to open or add guiding copy.<br>• Add explicit label ‘Color’ visible in viewport and keyboard focusable.<br>• Write an e2e test that asserts its presence before allowing task submission. |
| **Inconsistent spacing, padding, and button styling** | Visual inconsistency makes product feel unfinished and distracts users from their goal. | • Introduce a spacing scale (4-8-12-20 px) and apply via CSS variables.<br>• Use design-token-based button component across the app. |
| **Low text/background contrast** | Impacts readability and fails WCAG AA, especially for color-blind users. | • Run a contrast checker, update palette or increase font weight/size where needed. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix Add-Task button stability (disable transition until mounted or increase hit-area).**
2. **Ensure ‘Color’ section renders and is visible without scrolling or extra clicks.**
3. **Add/align missing labels for ‘Select Categories’ and ‘Task Deadline’; quick HTML tweaks with immediate clarity gains.**
4. **Increase text/background contrast to meet WCAG AA (can be done by adjusting two CSS variables).**
5. **Apply uniform padding/margin token to modal fields to clean up visual clutter.**
