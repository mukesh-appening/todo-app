## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> The session starts with moderate confidence‚Äîpages load and fields are visible. Minor visual inconsistencies already plant a seed of doubt. Confidence drops sharply when the first critical action (form validation) fails with no feedback. It rebounds briefly as subsequent flows start, but frustration mounts with repeated hard stops: missing checkbox, missing tagline, missing PWA prompt. By the end, the user feels stalled, doubtful about reliability, and visually underwhelmed.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                              | Why It Matters                                                                                                 | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Form validation & error messaging**                             | Without instant, clear feedback users cannot correct mistakes, causing abandonment.                            | ‚Ä¢ Ensure required fields surface helper-text and aria-describedby attributes on submit or onBlur.<br>‚Ä¢ Write unit tests that assert error messages appear within 200 ms.<br>‚Ä¢ Visually differentiate error state (red border, icon) to draw attention. |
| **Control discoverability (checkbox, PWA prompt, share options)** | If primary controls are hidden, mis-labelled, or outside viewport, core flows break and trust erodes.          | ‚Ä¢ Add explicit checkbox element with accessible label inside each task row.<br>‚Ä¢ Expose share / install actions via consistently placed buttons with icon + text.<br>‚Ä¢ Instrument analytics to detect zero-click controls and iterate on placement.    |
| **Visual hierarchy, typography, spacing**                         | Inconsistent type scales and padding make the interface feel unpolished and impede scannability.               | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a type scale (e.g. 14 / 16 / 20 / 28) and apply via theme tokens.<br>‚Ä¢ Run a global CSS audit to normalise margin/padding variables.<br>‚Ä¢ Create a simple style guide so new components inherit the same rhythm.                               |
| **Button styling & affordance**                                   | Unclear or too-small buttons damage usability, especially on touch devices.                                    | ‚Ä¢ Set min-touch size 44√ó44 px; increase font weight for primary CTAs.<br>‚Ä¢ Maintain consistent border-radius and colour for interactive elements.<br>‚Ä¢ Add hover / focus states to reinforce clickability.                                             |
| **Content loading & empty states**                                | Automated and human testers alike need predictable content; empty lists lead to failed locators and confusion. | ‚Ä¢ Seed demo data or show onboarding sample tasks when list is empty.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide skeleton loaders or placeholders to avoid locator timeouts.<br>‚Ä¢ Make tagline independent of data fetch so it always renders.                                        |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Add reliable, visible validation messages for required fields (blocks form flow today).**
2. **Insert an explicit, accessible checkbox for completing tasks; verify it toggles state.**
3. **Standardise typography and spacing using a global style sheet to remove ‚Äòlooks off‚Äô impressions quickly.**
4. **Pre-populate the app with a couple of sample tasks or an informative empty-state so list-based tests don‚Äôt fail.**
5. **Ensure PWA install prompt logic is triggered (or offer manual ‚ÄòInstall app‚Äô button) so users can finish the offline flow.**
