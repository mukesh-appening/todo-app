## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Excited on first load → mild confusion in modal (lots of fields) → sharp frustration when ’Create Task’ button won’t respond → uncertainty due to lack of success messages → relief when tasks eventually appear → annoyance at visual clutter / mis-aligned UI → distrust when share/download features don’t work → fatigue after many retries.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                              | Status     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch & onboarding               | ✅ pass    | All scenarios start by loading http://localhost:5173 successfully.                                                                                                                                            |
| Create a task (core flow)         | ❌ fail    | User opens ‘Add Task’ modal.; Fills in fields, but ‘Create Task’ button is often blocked by the still-open category dropdown (z-index / focus bug).; Result: timeout – task never created; no success toast.  |
| Move / reorder task               | ❌ blocked | Flow never executed because previous task was not created.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Edit, complete, favourite & pin   | ❌ mixed   | When task does exist, edit / complete / favourite generally works but user must scroll to find save buttons.; Visual indicators (strikethrough, star fill, pin icon) are subtle; users look for confirmation. |
| Category management               | ❌ fail    | Adding a new category (‘Hobby’) appears to work, but list never refreshes – user concludes it failed.; Editing a category (rename & colour) works after multiple clicks; UI feedback is minimal.              |
| Share task (link / QR / calendar) | ❌ fail    | Share dialog opens but link copy / QR download / .ics export are unreliable – repeated retries, manual right-click to download. No confirmation messages.                                                     |
| Settings – Appearance             | ❌ partial | User can cycle through themes & motion settings, but some options (‘Auto’ dark mode, disable glow) never register.; No global toast confirming preference saved.                                              |
| Install PWA                       | ❌ fail    | Tester cannot find an ‘Install App’ prompt – flow dead-ends.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Logout                            | ❌ partial | Logout button clicked, redirected, but no explicit ‘You are logged out’ message.                                                                                                                              |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                    | Why It Matters                                                                                               | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction blockers (overlays intercepting clicks)** | Primary CTA (‘Create Task’) is unusable when category popover sits above it – users think the app is broken. | • Close popover on selection or click outside.<br>• Add z-index/ pointer-events:none to menu when modal expects submission.<br>• Add E2E test specifically for this regression.                      |
| **Consistent visual system**                            | Inconsistent typography, spacing and button styling makes the product feel unpolished and lowers trust.      | • Adopt a design-token spacing scale (e.g. 4/8/16).<br>• Create a single Button component for all variants; replace ad-hoc buttons.<br>• Audit font sizes/weights; set global heading & body styles. |
| **Feedback & status messaging**                         | Users don’t know if actions succeeded (task added, category saved, logout, share link copied).               | • Emit Snackbar/Toast on all CRUD and share actions.<br>• Display inline icon changes (filled star, checkmark) with small micro-animations.<br>• Add empty-state and success-state copy for clarity. |
| **Discoverability of advanced actions**                 | Three-dot menus hide important functions; testers scour UI, causing friction.                                | • Add hover tooltips or labels.<br>• Surface high-value actions (Share, Pin) as icons directly on card for desktop widths.<br>• Introduce guided onboarding for new users.                           |
| **Accessibility & colour contrast**                     | Multiple reports of low contrast and unclear colour tokens – affects readability and WCAG compliance.        | • Run automated contrast audit; adjust palette.<br>• Ensure dark-mode variants meet 4.5:1 contrast.<br>• Add focus outlines for keyboard nav.                                                        |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix popover/overlay bug that blocks ‘Create Task’ (close on selection & adjust z-index).**
2. **Add universal toast/snackbar component for success & error states (task created, category saved, link copied, etc.).**
3. **Standardise Button component styling and apply across modals, dialogs and menus.**
4. **Implement spacing / padding token system to eliminate inconsistent gaps quickly.**
5. **Run quick colour-contrast pass on primary text & button states to hit WCAG AA.**
