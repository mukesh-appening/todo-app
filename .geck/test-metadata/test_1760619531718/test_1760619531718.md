## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Initial curiosity and confidence drop quickly to frustration as core controls (checkbox, dark-mode toggle, install prompt, file-upload button) fail to appear or respond. Each new feature exploration starts with hope but stalls at a missing or invisible UI element, compounding disappointment. Visual inconsistencies (spacing, contrast) subtly erode trust throughout. Overall feeling: increasing frustration, low confidence in reliability.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing / undiscoverable primary controls (checkbox, dark-mode toggle, share text, install prompt, file-upload)** | If essential actions are not rendered, users cannot complete key tasks, causing abandonment and negative perception. | • Audit DOM for conditional rendering logic; ensure elements mount for all viewport sizes and render states.<br>• Add automated tests for presence of primary interactive elements.<br>• Provide fallback text or alternative actions if advanced features are unsupported (e.g., PWA prompt). |
| **Click interception & hit-area issues (file-upload label overlaps input, small buttons)**                          | Pointer interception or tiny tappable areas block progression, especially on touch devices.                          | • Increase clickable area padding; use pointer-events CSS only when necessary.<br>• Run accessibility tooling to highlight overlapped elements.<br>• Add visual focus states to show what is actually clickable.                                                                               |
| **Visual consistency – typography, spacing, colour contrast**                                                       | Inconsistent hierarchy and low contrast reduce readability and perceived polish, particularly for accessibility.     | • Establish design tokens / style-guide and apply via global classes.<br>• Run automated contrast checks; adjust palette to meet WCAG 2.1 AA.<br>• Standardise spacing scale for forms and lists.                                                                                              |
| **Form validation feedback**                                                                                        | Missing or inconsistent error messages leave users unsure how to proceed, blocking conversion.                       | • Ensure all required fields surface inline error messages on blur/submit.<br>• Add ARIA-live regions so assistive tech announces errors.<br>• Include overview summary of missing fields above the form.                                                                                      |
| **Progress & status visibility (progress bar, badge counts)**                                                       | Users rely on immediate feedback to confirm actions like task completion or offline sync.                            | • Update progress indicators via state management observable to avoid stale UI.<br>• Introduce skeleton states or subtle animations to signal change.                                                                                                                                          |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Guarantee rendering and visibility of primary interactive elements (checkbox, dark-mode toggle, share tagline, install prompt, upload button).**
2. **Fix click interception and enlarge hit-areas for all buttons/inputs to ensure reliable interaction.**
3. **Implement consistent, accessible error messaging for all form validations (task creation, imports).**
4. **Improve colour contrast and typography using a shared design token system for quick visual uplift.**
5. **Add real-time UI feedback for progress indicators and badge counts once core interactions are reliable.**
