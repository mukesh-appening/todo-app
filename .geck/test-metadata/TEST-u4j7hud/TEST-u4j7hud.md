## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User starts confident (app loads quickly). Filling in the task form feels okay but slightly sloppy because of visual inconsistency. Frustration spikes when the category menu blocks the Create-Task button – user can’t proceed. Even when tasks are created, the lack of clear success feedback leaves the user uncertain. Marking tasks complete is satisfying but reversing status or pinning a task gives no confirmation, leading to renewed doubt. Overall arc: Confidence → Mild friction → Major blockage → Recovery → Uncertainty.

| Open “Add Task” modal                                                      | ✅ pass    | User clicks the + / Add-Task button and modal appears in four of five relevant tests.; Minor UI issues (button style, spacing) flagged but flow is unblocked.                                                     |
| Populate task fields (name, description, deadline, category, color, emoji) | ✅ pass    | Data entry succeeds in every flow; repeated visual-consistency warnings (typography, label alignment, padding).                                                                                                   |
| Submit task via “Create Task” button                                       | ❌ fail    | Drag-and-Move scenario: category dropdown (MuiPopover) sits above the Create-Task button and intercepts clicks → hard failure (timeout).; Other tests succeed but still note inconsistent button styling.         |
| System feedback after creating / editing task                              | ❌ mixed   | Success toast or inline confirmation frequently missing; several tests resort to checking the list manually.; Lack of feedback causes test zlekvij to fail when ‘Mark as not done’ shows no confirmation message. |

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modal layout & visual consistency (typography, spacing, button styling)** | Inconsistent UI erodes trust and makes forms feel unfinished or buggy.                                                | • Audit font sizes/weights for headers, labels, inputs.<br>• Establish spacing scale (e.g., 8-pt grid) and apply consistently.<br>• Create a Button component with canonical size, radius, color and swap all ad-hoc buttons. |
| **Z-index / overlay management (category dropdown blocks main CTA)**        | Users literally cannot submit the form when the popover obscures the primary action.                                  | • Ensure Popover closes on selection (or outside click).<br>• Give Popover a lower z-index than modal footer, or move Create-Task button above fold.<br>• Add automated test to detect element obstruction before release.    |
| **Explicit success & status feedback**                                      | Without confirmation, users are unsure their action worked, leading to duplicate actions or abandonment.              | • Add toast/snackbar (“Task created”, “Task updated”) with ARIA live region.<br>• Show inline checkmark/strikethrough immediately after status change.<br>• Log analytics event to verify feedback fires.                     |
| **State-change visibility (pin icon, mark-as-not-done)**                    | Visual cues are the user’s proof that state has changed; missing icons or styling undermines feature discoverability. | • Design and add pinned icon asset; position consistently on card.<br>• Ensure ‘Mark as not done’ toggles checkmark/strikethrough off instantly.<br>• Write Cypress/Playwright assertions for icon presence.                  |
| **Accessibility & color contrast**                                          | Poor contrast harms readability and fails WCAG AA, excluding users with low vision.                                   | • Run automated contrast audit (axe, Lighthouse); adjust palette.<br>• Provide focus outlines on interactive elements.<br>• Test dark/light themes.                                                                           |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix Popover overlay so “Create Task” button is always clickable (close on select or adjust z-index).**
2. **Implement toast/snackbar confirmations for create, update, pin/unpin, mark done/undone.**
3. **Add pinned icon and ensure state toggle instantly reflects on card.**
4. **Standardize button component and apply across modal & dashboard for consistent look/feel.**
5. **Quick typography & spacing sweep using a defined spacing scale to eliminate obvious visual drift.**
