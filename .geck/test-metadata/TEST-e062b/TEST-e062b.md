## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts confident: app loads quickly. Enthusiasm dips as modal looks unpolished (fonts & spacing). Anxiety spikes when “Create Task” doesn’t respond because a menu blocks clicks. Relief when a task finally appears, but confidence never fully recovers because visual confirmations are spotty. Further frustration arises when actions like Pin or Mark-as-Not-Done give no feedback, leaving the user unsure if the app worked. Overall feeling: "I can get things done, but I’m never 100 % sure and the UI feels slightly messy."

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                                                                               | Status   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Landing on the dashboard                                                           | ✅ pass  | All scenarios start by navigating to http://localhost:5173 and loading the dashboard successfully.                                                                                        |
| Opening “Add Task” modal                                                           | ✅ pass  | Users click the + / Add-Task button; the modal usually appears, but typography, spacing and button-style issues are repeatedly flagged.                                                   |
| Filling in task details                                                            | ✅ pass  | Users enter name, description, deadline, category, colour and emoji. Multiple UI checks note mis-aligned labels, inconsistent padding and typography.                                     |
| Submitting the task                                                                | ❌ fail  | Critical failure in Drag & Move Task test – step 8: ‘Create Task’ button never receives the click because the category dropdown remains open and intercepts pointer events (timeout 5 s). |
| Seeing feedback / new task in list                                                 | ❌ mixed | Some flows show success and new task in list; others (e.g. Add Task, Delete Task) never surface a toast or visual confirmation, causing uncertainty.                                      |
| Manipulating existing tasks (move, pin, mark done/undone, edit, duplicate, delete) | ❌ mixed | • Move: test never ran because task creation failed, so drag-reorder is untested.                                                                                                         |

• Pin: steps execute until verifying pin icon at top – pending → test marked failed.
• Mark as Not Done: visual change succeeded, but no notification surfaced → step failed.
• Edit: lengthy edit flow runs, but no clear ‘Save’ action visible; relies on screenshots rather than UI state verification.
• Duplicate & Delete: operations run but confirmations (success toast / list refresh) are missing, leading to shaky pass criteria. |
| Hard failures summary | ❌ fail | 1. Create Task button blocked by open menu (TEST-gp6fsae, Step 8). 2. Add New Category test never started (all steps pending). 3. Missing success notification causes failure (Mark Task as Not Done, Step 6). 4. Pin verification never completed (Pin a Task, Step 15 pending). |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                              | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                                    | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistent visual design (typography, padding, button styles)** | Repeated ‘looks off’ flags erode perceived quality and trust; inconsistent spacing makes forms feel cluttered.                                                    | • Adopt a design-token / theme system for font sizes & weights.<br>• Audit padding / margin scale (e.g. 8-pt grid) across modals, menus and cards.<br>• Create a shared MUI button variant and replace ad-hoc styles.                                          |
| **Modal workflow & overlay behaviour**                            | Open menus remain on top of action buttons, blocking interactions (hard failure).                                                                                 | • Auto-close dropdown/menus when the user clicks outside or when focus shifts.<br>• Disable underlying buttons while a dropdown is open, or z-index menus beneath primary CTA.<br>• Add E2E tests specifically for ‘Create Task’ with open dropdown edge-case. |
| **Action feedback (toasts / inline status)**                      | Users don’t know if an operation succeeded (delete, pin, duplicate, mark not done). Missing feedback caused test assertions to fail and would confuse real users. | • Show ephemeral toast ‘Task created’, ‘Task deleted’, etc.<br>• Animate the task card (fade/slide) when state changes.<br>• Log actions to an activity feed for later confirmation.                                                                           |
| **Accessibility & colour contrast**                               | Colour contrast issues reported; poor accessibility excludes users and may fail compliance.                                                                       | • Run automated contrast checker (WCAG AA) on palette.<br>• Adjust category colours or add darker foreground text.<br>• Offer alternate theme / high-contrast mode.                                                                                            |
| **List state sync after operations**                              | Pin, duplicate, edit and delete rely on the list refreshing; when it doesn’t, tests stall and users must refresh.                                                 | • After any mutation, update list via optimistic UI or refetch query.<br>• Scroll to / highlight the affected task so users see the result.<br>• Add loading indicator if refresh might take >300 ms.                                                          |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix dropdown overlay that blocks ‘Create Task’ button (close-on-select & outside-click).**
2. **Add universal toast component for create, edit, delete, pin/unpin, etc.**
3. **Implement a design token system (fonts, spacing, button variants) and run quick CSS sweep to align modal inputs & labels.**
4. **Improve colour contrast for category pills and buttons to meet WCAG AA.**
5. **Ensure list re-renders immediately after task mutations (optimistic update or refetch).**
