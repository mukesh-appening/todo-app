## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> The journey starts with mild optimism that quickly drops to irritation as basic alignment / style issues are visible everywhere. Confidence dips further when clicking “Create Task” does nothing (blocked by menu). Small victories (tasks marked done, themes toggled) bring brief relief, but lack of feedback leaves the user uncertain. Repetitive spelling mistakes and the impossible PWA install create frustration and doubt about polish. Overall feeling: "This works… but barely, and sure doesn’t feel finished."

| Step                                                                       | Status     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch & initial load                                                      | ✅ pass    | All tests begin by navigating to http://localhost:5173.; UI review consistently flags basic layout issues (typography, spacing, color contrast) on the very first screen.                                                                                                                       |
| Open “Add Task” modal                                                      | ✅ pass    | Users locate the “+ / Add Task” trigger from the dashboard in several scenarios.; Minor visual bugs: Add-button style does not match surrounding UI.                                                                                                                                            |
| Fill out task details                                                      | ✅ pass    | Users type name, description, deadline, category, colour, emoji.; Throughout these forms, automated UI checks repeatedly report: mis-aligned labels, inconsistent font sizes, irregular padding.                                                                                                |
| Submit new task                                                            | ❌ fail    | Critical functional miss in Drag-and-Move flow – click on “Create Task” is intercepted by the still-open category menu (timeout & retry loop).; Success-toast / list-update is often not detected; tests rely on visual confirmation that never appears.                                        |
| Manipulate existing tasks (move, pin, duplicate, delete, mark done/undone) | ❌ mixed   | Most CRUD actions eventually succeed but with shaky feedback: • No visual success cues when marking done/undone. • Deleting & purging tasks lacks clear confirmation copy and has spelling errors (‘taks’).; Drag-to-reorder never exercised because task creation failed earlier in that flow. |
| Settings → Appearance                                                      | ❌ partial | Users can toggle Dark/Light/System and motion preferences, but two steps remain pending (Auto motion, disable Glow) indicating missing controls or unclear affordances.; UI audit again notes inconsistent button shapes and overcrowded labels.                                                |
| Install as PWA                                                             | ❌ failed  | Tester repeatedly searches for an install entry-point but cannot surface browser install prompt; all downstream steps fail.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Category management (add / edit / favourite)                               | ❌ pending | Flows queued or running; not enough data yet, but missing navigation entry-points already suspected from earlier tests.                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                  | Why It Matters                                                                                                       | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Form & layout consistency**         | Misaligned labels, uneven padding, and typography jumps create instant distrust and slow users down.                 | • Adopt a single spacing / typography scale (e.g. 8-pt grid, style-tokens).<br>• Run automated linting (Stylelint / eslint-css-in-js) to flag off-spec components.            |
| **Action feedback & toasts**          | Users can’t tell whether Create, Delete, Move, etc. actually happened, leading to repeated clicks and test failures. | • Emit non-blocking toast or inline status after every CRUD action.<br>• Add ARIA live-region so screen-readers also announce status.                                         |
| **Modal / menu z-index logic**        | Open dropdown intercepts clicks on underlying primary buttons (hard-fail in automation, confusing in real life).     | • Auto-close category menu on selection OR disable background buttons while menu is open.<br>• Regression test: ensure `pointer-events` don’t route through overlay children. |
| **Button & icon styling**             | Inconsistent size, colour, shape erodes brand trust and slows recognition.                                           | • Create reusable Button component with variants; purge ad-hoc CSS.<br>• Audit all icon sizes (24 px or 20 px) and align baselines.                                           |
| **Spelling / copy polish**            | Typos (“taks”, “Catgeory”) make the product feel unprofessional.                                                     | • Run copy pass or integrate spell-checker in CI.<br>• Add UX-writing guidance for confirmation dialogs.                                                                      |
| **PWA install path**                  | Failed install blocks an advertised feature and undermines cross-platform promise.                                   | • Add in-app prompt (`beforeinstallprompt`) and dedicated menu item.<br>• Update onboarding doc to show how to install via browser menu if prompt dismissed.                  |
| **Accessibility – colour & contrast** | Several checks flag low contrast; this excludes low-vision users and may fail WCAG.                                  | • Use palette tooling to verify AA contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text.<br>• Offer theme presets that pass contrast by default.                                                         |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix dropdown/modal overlap so “Create Task” is always clickable (close menu on select).**
2. **Introduce success/error toast component for all task actions.**
3. **Standardise typography, padding and button component via design-token refactor.**
4. **Correct spelling errors in confirmation dialogs and success messages.**
5. **Add `beforeinstallprompt` PWA flow and surface an explicit “Install App” entry in the UI.**
