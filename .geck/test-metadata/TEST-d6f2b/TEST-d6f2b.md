## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User enters with confidence, quickly notices visual rough edges (inconsistent fonts & spacing). Creating a task feels ok until dropdowns obstruct buttons—frustration spikes. Lack of success toasts keeps them unsure. Advanced actions (move, share, install, add-category) have hidden states or fail silently, leading to repeated attempts and confusion. When something finally works (edit category, purge), typos and subtle feedback dampen any delight. Overall mood oscillates between tentative hope and mounting frustration.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                           | Status                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Landing on the app          | ✅ pass               | Most test cases begin successfully at http://localhost:5173.; Early UI reviews already flag inconsistent typography, padding and button styling.                                                                                                      |
| 2. Creating a task             | ❌ mixed              | Flow generally works (e.g. test Add Task) but in Drag & Move scenario, the ‘Create Task’ button is blocked by an open dropdown ➜ hard failure (step 8).; Success feedback after creation is often missing or not detected.                            |
| 3. Manipulating existing tasks | ❌ mixed              | Mark as Done, Pin Task, Move Task all rely on three-dot menus; they pass in some tests but often end in pending/failed states when UI feedback is unclear (e.g. pin verification pending, drag-and-drop never reached).                               |
| 4. Category management         | ❌ mixed              | Editing a category works (Work→Office).; Adding new category ‘Hobby’ fails – form submits but the category never appears and no error surfaces (steps 7-8 = hard failure).; Favourite-star feature technically works but visual indication is subtle. |
| 5. Settings / Appearance       | ❌ partial            | Theme & reduce-motion toggles switch, but several sub-steps remain pending; users are unsure if changes are applied because there’s no global confirmation toast.; Glow-effect toggle lacks clear ON/OFF feedback.                                    |
| 6. Sharing tasks               | ❌ mixed              | Copy-link flow eventually passes but confirmation message is easy to miss.; QR-code download flow stalls—buttons hard to find, no final evidence of download or validation (steps 8-9 pending).                                                       |
| 7. PWA install                 | ❌ fail               | Tester cannot find ‘Install App’ option; install-related steps 5-8 fail, implying PWA not configured or discoverable.                                                                                                                                 |
| 8. Purge all tasks             | ❌ pass-with-warnings | Action completes but success text contains typos (‘taks’).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 9. Export to calendar          | ❌ running            | Feature still in progress; prior share–calendar tab reviews suggest discoverability issues.                                                                                                                                                           |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design consistency (typography, spacing, button styles)**              | Visual polish is the first trust signal; inconsistencies make the product feel unfinished and can hurt comprehension.                                | • Adopt a design-token system (headings, labels, body copy, spacing scale).<br>• Create shared button component variants and replace ad-hoc styles.<br>• Run an automated lint/style check in CI for new PRs.                                                                                                        |
| **Action feedback & confirmations**                                      | Several flows leave users guessing (task creation, category add, theme change, link copy). Clear, timely feedback reduces anxiety and repeat clicks. | • Introduce contextual toast notifications (‘Task created’, ‘Category saved’, etc.).<br>• Ensure destructive actions (purge, delete) and install / share flows always surface confirmation modals or banners.<br>• Add a loading / disabled state to primary buttons after click.                                    |
| **Clickable overlays & z-index issues**                                  | In Drag & Move test, a menu item intercepts clicks, blocking ‘Create Task’. Users perceive the app as broken.                                        | • Audit z-index stacking context; close dropdowns automatically when focus leaves.<br>• Add outside-click handlers to dismiss menus before other actions.<br>• Write Cypress test specifically for “dropdown should not block primary CTA”.                                                                          |
| **Feature discoverability (three-dot menu, share options, PWA install)** | Core features are hidden behind small icons or multiple layers, causing failure or user abandonment.                                                 | • Add helper text or onboarding tooltip the first time a user hovers over the three-dot menu.<br>• Surface share actions (Link, QR, Calendar) as tabs with clear labels and primary buttons.<br>• Expose an “Install App” button in the sidebar when PWA criteria are met, or hide the menu item when not supported. |
| **Error handling & empty states**                                        | Category creation fails silently; install flow returns no guidance. Users feel stuck.                                                                | • Return API/validation errors inline under the form field.<br>• Show guidance (“PWA install not supported in Safari; try Chrome”) when install fails.<br>• Add empty-state illustrations with ‘Add your first…’ CTAs.                                                                                               |
| **Accessibility & contrast**                                             | Color-contrast warnings appear repeatedly; impacts readability and compliance.                                                                       | • Run automated a11y checks (axe-core) in CI.<br>• Update palette to hit WCAG AA at minimum, especially for disabled text and icons.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Implement universal toast/alert system for success & error states (task, category, theme, share, etc.).**
2. **Fix dropdown / menu z-index so primary buttons (e.g., ‘Create Task’) are never obstructed; auto-close on selection or outside click.**
3. **Create and apply a spacing & typography scale via CSS variables or design tokens for immediate visual consistency.**
4. **Add explicit ‘Install App’ button with feature-detection; hide or grey it out if PWA not available.**
5. **Add clear copy and icons for Share flow (Link, QR, Calendar) with a visible ‘Download QR’ primary button.]}**
