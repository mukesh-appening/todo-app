## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts confident (app loads), mild annoyance grows with sloppy visual spacing. A spike of frustration hits when the Create Task button is un-clickable. Subsequent tasks work but lack success messages, leaving the shopper uncertain. Re-open / pin flows feel unfinished, creating lingering doubt rather than delight.

| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch app             | ✅ pass  | All tests begin by navigating to http://localhost:5173 and see the dashboard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Add a new task         | ❌ mixed | Users open the “Add Task” modal and fill in name, description, deadline, category, colour, emoji.; Visual issues reported in every modal step (inconsistent typography, spacing, button style).; HARD FAILURE: In the Drag & Move Task scenario, the Create Task button cannot be clicked because the open category dropdown intercepts the click (step 8 ‑ fail) – flow blocks and later steps stay pending. |
| Re-order (Drag & Move) | ❌ fail  | Because task creation fails, user never reaches drag-and-drop steps (steps 9-16 pending).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Mark task as done      | ✅ pass  | User can mark a task complete and sees it leave the active list, but screenshots suggest visual feedback is subtle; many “no confirmation message observed” notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mark task as NOT done  | ❌ mixed | User re-opens a completed task; UI changes back correctly, but no toast/notification appears (step 6 fail).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Pin a task             | ❌ mixed | User attempts to pin a task; actions recorded, but final verification step remains pending – no clear indicator that pin was successful (step 15 pending).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| View task details      | ✅ pass  | Task-details modal opens from three-dot menu; information appears accurate, though labels mis-aligned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Edit a task            | ✅ pass  | User goes through edit flow; fields accept changes and Save seems to work, but logs show repeated uncertainty about whether Save was really clicked or reflected in list (weak feedback).                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Add new category       | ❌ fail  | Entire test stuck in ‘pending’ – category management flow may not be implemented or navigation isn’t obvious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                  | Why It Matters                                                                                           | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clickable-overlay & modal stacking**                | Blocking element over the Create Task button prevents core action; users think the app is broken.        | • Close dropdown automatically when an option is picked OR disable it before showing other buttons.<br>• Add z-index audit/tests so popovers don’t intercept clicks.<br>• Include visual cue when a dropdown is still open. |
| **Feedback & confirmation messages**                  | Users repeatedly see no toast, badge or list update and question whether actions succeeded.              | • Show toast/snackbar for Create, Edit, Pin, Mark-done/undone.<br>• Animate list insertion/re-ordering so change is obvious.<br>• Add ARIA live-region for accessibility.                                                   |
| **Visual consistency (typography, spacing, buttons)** | Inconsistent UI erodes trust and makes forms harder to scan.                                             | • Adopt design tokens / theme system; use single type scale and spacing scale.<br>• Create shared Button and Input components; replace ad-hoc styles.<br>• Run automated linting (Stylelint) and visual regression tests.   |
| **Accessibility & colour contrast**                   | Low contrast colours hurt readability and fail WCAG; dropdown intercept issue is also a focus trap risk. | • Run Lighthouse/axe audit; adjust primary & category colours to meet 4.5:1 contrast.<br>• Ensure focus outline visible on all interactive elements.                                                                        |
| **Task list real-time updates**                       | User can’t tell if edits or second task creation succeeded; uncertainty lowers confidence.               | • After successful API response, scroll task into view and briefly highlight it.<br>• Ensure optimistic UI update before network round-trip.                                                                                |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix dropdown popover intercepting Create Task click (close on select or raise z-index).**
2. **Add universal toast/snackbar for success & error states (Create, Edit, Pin, etc.).**
3. **Introduce shared Button & Input components to unify typography, padding and colours quickly.**
4. **Improve colour contrast of text & category chips to meet WCAG AA.**
5. **Auto-collapse modal / highlight new task in list to reassure users action worked.**
