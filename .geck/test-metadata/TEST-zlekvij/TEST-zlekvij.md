## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts confident (app loads) → mild discomfort (inconsistent visuals) → rising frustration (open dropdown blocks Create-Task) → confusion (no success confirmation) → relief in one long run that finally completes → disappointment when status-change shows no notification.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                                            | Status          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch application                              | ✅ pass         | All tests successfully opened http://localhost:5173.                                                                                                                                   |
| Open “Add Task” modal                           | ✅ pass         | Users clicked the Add-Task (+) button; modal appeared. Minor UI inconsistencies in button style and spacing were noted.                                                                |
| Fill task details (name, description, deadline) | ✅ pass         | Typing worked, but typography, label alignment and padding looked off in every screen.                                                                                                 |
| Choose category                                 | ✅ pass         | Dropdown opened and a category (🏢 Work, etc.) was selected. The open menu remained on-screen. Color contrast issue flagged.                                                           |
| Create Task (submit form)                       | ❌ fail         | In two separate tests the click on “Create Task” timed-out because the still-open category menu intercepted the pointer. Core flow blocked.                                            |
| System feedback after create                    | ❌ mixed        | Where the click failed, no feedback was shown (hard stop). In the tests where it passed, success messages were unclear or absent; users had to scroll/look around to confirm creation. |
| Re-ordering & pinning tasks                     | ❌ not reached  | Because task creation failed, move/reorder/pin scenarios never executed.                                                                                                               |
| Mark task as done                               | ✅ pass         | One end-to-end run succeeded; checkbox updated task state, but visual change required multiple clicks to notice.                                                                       |
| Mark task as NOT done                           | ❌ fail         | Visual state reverted, but the app displayed no confirmation message, causing the automated check to fail.                                                                             |
| Add new category                                | ❌ not executed | Whole scenario remained pending; likely blocked by earlier reliability issues.                                                                                                         |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                         | Why It Matters                                                                         | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Form submission obstructed by open dropdown**              | Primary task flow (creating a task) fails; users cannot proceed.                       | • Automatically close the category menu as soon as a selection is made.<br>• Or place the Create-Task button outside the dropdown’s z-index area.<br>• Add escape-key / outside-click handlers to dismiss overlays. |
| **Lack of explicit success & status messages**               | Users are uncertain whether an action (create / mark done / mark not done) worked.     | • Trigger toast or inline alert after every CRUD action.<br>• Include ARIA live-region for accessibility.<br>• Write concise, friendly copy: “Task created 🎉” / “Task marked complete”.                            |
| **Visual consistency (typography, spacing, button styling)** | Inconsistent UI erodes trust and makes scanning harder, especially in forms and lists. | • Define design tokens for font sizes, weights, spacing.<br>• Audit components against tokens; update modal inputs & buttons.<br>• Run automated linting (stylelint) or component tests to catch regressions.       |
| **Color contrast & branding**                                | Insufficient contrast hurts accessibility (WCAG) and brand perception.                 | • Check palette against WCAG AA/AAA using automated tools.<br>• Adjust foreground/background pairs; document brand color usage.                                                                                     |
| **Task-list visibility & scrolling**                         | Users had to scroll and hunt to verify newly added tasks.                              | • Auto-scroll or highlight newly added task.<br>• Optionally collapse the form after success to reveal the list.<br>• Provide filter/sort so new items are obvious.                                                 |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix overlay-intercept bug so “Create Task” click always works (close dropdown or adjust z-index).**
2. **Add clear toast/snackbar confirmations for create / update / revert actions.**
3. **Standardise typography & spacing using a shared style guide to remove the most visible visual inconsistencies.**
4. **Improve color contrast on buttons and text to reach WCAG AA.**
5. **Auto-focus or highlight the newly created task in the list to reassure users their action succeeded.**
