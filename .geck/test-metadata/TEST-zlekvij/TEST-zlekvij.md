## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts confident (dashboard loads quickly) → mild annoyance (layout looks slightly “off”) → rising frustration (modal feels cluttered / labels mis-aligned) → blocked & confused (can’t find Colour picker) → outright frustration / mistrust (Create Task button unresponsive) → abandonment (user gives up before any advanced task-management features).

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch & land on Dashboard | ✅ pass | All 5 tests open http://localhost:5173 successfully, but screenshots already show style inconsistencies (button styling, typography, spacing). |
| Open “Add Task” modal | ✅ pass | User clicks the Add Task FAB/ button. Modal appears in every run. Early UI-review flags: mis-aligned labels, cramped spacing, uneven padding. |
| Fill in Task details | ✅ pass | Typing Task Name, Description, Deadline, Categories generally works.; Repeated visual issues: labels mis-aligned, missing 'Select Categories' label, inconsistent font sizes, low colour contrast. |
| Choose Colour | ❌ fail | In 2 runs (Add New Task, Mark Task as done) the flow halts because the Colour section / picker cannot be located. |
| Submit via “Create Task” button | ❌ fail | 3 runs (Drag & Move Task, Pin a Task, Mark Task as Not Done) time-out trying to click Create Task.; Root cause surfaced in logs: category dropdown pop-over is left open and intercepts the pointer, blocking the button. |
| Post-creation actions (emoji, pin, drag, mark done/not-done) | ❌ not reached | Because the task is never created, all subsequent steps stay in ‘pending’. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Global spacing & alignment** | Crowded or mis-aligned forms feel sloppy and hurt scannability, slowing data entry. | • Add a base 8-pt spacing scale and apply through theme / CSS vars.<br>• Audit flex/grid layouts in the modal – align labels and inputs in consistent columns.<br>• Add automatic visual regression tests for spacing. |
| **Label visibility & hierarchy** | Missing or mis-placed labels (“Select Categories”, “Task Deadline”) force users to guess what a field is for; accessibility suffers. | • Ensure every input has an explicit <label> element linked via for / id.<br>• Use consistent typography tokens for titles, labels, helper text.<br>• Run an a11y checker (axe, Lighthouse) on the modal. |
| **Button style & interaction consistency** | Inconsistent sizes and styles damage brand trust and make CTAs harder to spot. | • Define primary / secondary button variants in the design system; replace ad-hoc class names.<br>• Add hover / focus states that meet WCAG contrast.<br>• Include buttons in a component snapshot test. |
| **Colour picker & colour usage** | Flow blocks completely when Colour section is missing; inconsistent colours violate brand guidelines. | • Make Colour picker a required, always-rendered component (or gracefully hide step).<br>• Provide default colour if user skips picker.<br>• Validate brand palette in CSS variables. |
| **Modal overlay & focus management** | Open dropdown menu intercepts clicks on “Create Task”, causing timeouts and user confusion. | • Close category menu on selection or on outside click.<br>• Trap focus within modal; pressing ‘Esc’ should close sub-menus first.<br>• Write e2e test: select category then click Create Task → should succeed. |
| **Typography consistency** | Uneven font sizes/weights make hierarchy unclear and impair readability. | • Adopt type scale (e.g., 14 / 16 / 20 / 24).<br>• Set base line-height and apply via theme.<br>• Run design QA checklist before merge. |
| **Colour contrast & accessibility** | Low contrast text fails WCAG AA, impacting users with low vision. | • Run automated contrast linting.<br>• Adjust palette to achieve 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.<br>• Offer dark-mode toggle only when colours are fixed. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix dropdown pop-over intercepting “Create Task” clicks – auto-close menu on selection or outside-click.**
2. **Re-enable / surface Colour picker section so flow can complete (or make it optional).**
3. **Standardise spacing & label alignment in the Add Task modal via a simple CSS grid / stack component.**
4. **Create shared button component with brand-approved styles and apply to Add Task & Create Task buttons.**
5. **Add automated a11y & visual regression tests (axe + chromatic) to catch label, contrast and spacing issues before shipping.**
