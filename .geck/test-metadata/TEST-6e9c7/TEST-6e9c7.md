## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User starts confident after quick page load. Mild disappointment sets in when first screen looks untidy. Filling the task form feels smooth until the Create button is unclickable – sharp frustration. Subsequent passes (other test cases) bring relief, but lack of clear feedback keeps confidence low. Repeated visual inconsistencies and spelling mistakes erode trust. Category-addition failure and missing PWA option add further frustration. Journey ends with mixed feelings: core tasks mostly doable, but polish and reliability feel lacking.

| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch & first impression                                | ✅ pass    | All tests begin by loading http://localhost:5173 successfully.; UI review consistently flags basic design issues (margins, inconsistent typography, weak colour contrast) on the landing screen.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Create a task                                            | ❌ mixed   | Modal opens and fields are filled without problem.; HARD FAILURE – in the Drag & Move Task flow the “Create Task” button cannot be clicked because a still-open dropdown intercepts the pointer (z-index / overlay issue).; Other ‘Add Task’ flows succeed but still surface UI inconsistencies (button styling, label alignment).                                                                       |
| Task list interactions (move, pin, mark done / not-done) | ❌ mixed   | Mark as done → works, but visual confirmation (strikethrough, colour change) is sometimes hard to spot.; Drag & move could not be tested because the task was never created (blocked in previous failure).; Pin to top – test stalls at visual verification (no clear ‘pinned’ state presented).; Re-open a completed task – action works but there is no toast / success message (hard failure logged). |
| Bulk actions – Purge All                                 | ✅ pass    | Purging tasks works but the confirmation dialog contains spelling errors (“taks”).; Success message appears, but again with misspelling and design inconsistencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Category management                                      | ❌ mixed   | Edit & favourite flows succeed (name changed to “Office”, star icon toggles).; HARD FAILURE – adding a new category called “Hobby” fails; user fills the form but category never appears and no error is shown.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Settings – Appearance                                    | ❌ partial | Dark / light / system theme toggles respond, but some sub-options remain ‘pending’ (e.g., Reduce Motion ‘System’, disabling Glow Effect).; Design audit continues to point out spacing / colour issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Progressive Web App install                              | ❌ fail    | User looks for an “Install App” option (Safari PWA) but cannot find it – flow ends with four failed steps and no screenshots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                              | Why It Matters                                                                                     | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interactive overlays / element blocking**                       | When a dropdown intercepts the ‘Create Task’ button, users cannot continue – core action blocked.  | • Close dropdown automatically once an option is chosen OR allow clicks to pass through.<br>• Add E2E test specifically for Create-Task flow with open dropdown. |
| **Consistent visual design (typography, spacing, button styles)** | Inconsistent UI erodes trust and makes scanning harder; flagged in almost every screenshot review. | • Adopt a design-token / theme system.<br>• Run a quick CSS audit (padding, font-sizes, button variants).<br>• Introduce a component library lint rule in CI.    |
| **Feedback & confirmation messages**                              | Users are unsure actions worked (mark not-done, pin, settings).                                    | • Add toast/snackbar after every CRUD action.<br>• Ensure visual state changes (e.g., strikethrough, star icon) are prominent and accessible.                    |
| **Copy & spelling quality**                                       | Errors (“taks”) look unprofessional and damage credibility.                                        | • Spell-check all static strings.<br>• Add copy review step before release.                                                                                      |
| **Category CRUD robustness**                                      | ‘Hobby’ category never appears – data integrity issue.                                             | • Add server/client validation and error handling.<br>• Show inline error if name duplicates or request fails.                                                   |
| **Accessibility – colour & contrast**                             | Several colour-contrast warnings; impacts users with low vision.                                   | • Run automated a11y audit (Lighthouse, axe).<br>• Adjust palette to meet WCAG AA at minimum.                                                                    |
| **PWA installation discoverability**                              | Failure suggests PWA meta-tags or manifest missing; hurts engagement on mobile.                    | • Verify manifest & service-worker registration.<br>• Provide explicit “Install App” button that calls `prompt()` when available.                                |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix the dropdown-overlay bug that blocks the Create Task button (adjust z-index / auto-close).**
2. **Add toast/snackbar confirmations for create, update, delete, pin, unpin actions.**
3. **Standardise typography, padding and button components via a shared style guide – quick CSS pass removes majority of ‘looks off’ flags.**
4. **Correct all spelling / copy errors in dialogs and messages (easiest credibility win).**
5. **Ensure ‘Add Category’ API returns success and show error state when it fails – prevents silent data loss.**
