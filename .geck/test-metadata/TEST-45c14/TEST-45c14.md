## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> A real shopper would start confident (app loads quickly), feel mild unease from visual rough edges, become frustrated by missing confirmations and click-blocking overlays, experience relief when an action finally works, and end with lingering doubt because several flows (install, new category, drag-and-drop) simply never succeed.

| Step                                     | Status     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Landing on the dashboard                 | ✅ pass    | All tests open http://localhost:5173 without trouble.; First visual impression regularly flagged for dull colours and mis-aligned typography.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Creating a task                          | ❌ mixed   | Most flows succeed in opening the “Add New Task” modal and filling fields.; Hard failure in Drag & Move Task: Create Task button could not be clicked because an open category menu intercepted pointer events (Playwright timeout).; Repeated UI review flags: uneven padding, inconsistent button styling, font-size drift.              |
| Post-creation feedback                   | ❌ weak    | Several scripts look for a success toast or for the new task in the list; many times no explicit confirmation is detected.; Test logs resort to scrolling and re-searching the list to verify success.                                                                                                                                     |
| Editing, moving, pinning and favouriting | ❌ mixed   | Editing and marking favourite eventually succeed, but scripts need many scrolls and clicks – the controls are hard to spot.; Moving (drag & drop) never executes because the flow stopped at the earlier Create Task failure.; Pin Task scenario stalls at visual verification; no distinct ‘pinned’ icon or list re-ordering is detected. |
| Settings & appearance                    | ❌ partial | Theme toggles (Light/Dark/System) work, but Reduce-Motion and Glow-Effect steps remain ‘pending’; tester could not find or confirm them.; Visual consistency issues (padding / margins) dominate the UI review comments.                                                                                                                   |
| Category management                      | ❌ fail    | Adding new category ‘Hobby’ fails – no toast, not present in list.; Editing an existing category works, but again takes many clicks; success relies on screenshot confirmation rather than UI feedback.                                                                                                                                    |
| Sharing tasks                            | ❌ partial | Copy-link path passes, but confirmation toast is missing or not visible.; QR-code share path: tester can open the tab, but can’t reliably download or verify the QR; final documentation step fails.                                                                                                                                       |
| PWA install                              | ❌ fail    | Tester cannot find ‘Install App’ – Safari offers no PWA prompt; subsequent standalone-app validations all fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Purge all tasks                          | ✅ pass    | Purge flow completes, but success message contains spelling errors (‘taks’, ‘tak’).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Interaction blockers (overlays intercepting clicks)**                         | Users perceive the app as broken when a visible button won’t respond.                               | • Automatically close dropdown / popover menus when focus leaves them or when another primary action button comes into view.<br>• Add z-index audits in CI to ensure modals and menus do not sit above critical buttons.                                                                                     |
| **Explicit feedback & toasts**                                                  | People need assurance that their action (create, edit, delete, share) actually succeeded.           | • Emit a concise toast (‘Task created’) with auto-dismiss and an ARIA live region.<br>• Show inline state changes immediately (e.g., new task card slides into list, favourite star fills).                                                                                                                  |
| **Visual consistency (typography, spacing, buttons)**                           | Inconsistent UI erodes trust and forces users to hunt for meaning instead of flowing through tasks. | • Adopt a design-token system for font sizes, weights, colours and spacing.<br>• Audit all MuiButton variants – use one size, one corner radius; apply same padding grid to inputs.                                                                                                                          |
| **Copy & micro-copy quality**                                                   | Misspellings (‘taks’) and vague labels (‘Glow Effect’) undermine professionalism and clarity.       | • Run spell-check across UI strings; add unit test that rejects common typos.<br>• Make action labels outcome-oriented (‘Download QR code’, ‘Install Todo App’).                                                                                                                                             |
| **Discoverability of advanced features (PWA install, reduce motion, share QR)** | Hidden or non-functional features frustrate power users and inflate support cost.                   | • Detect browser PWA support and surface an ‘Install App’ banner only when available.<br>• Populate the share dialog with clear primary + secondary actions; disable or hide QR tab if generator fails.<br>• Group appearance settings under clear headings; grey-out options unavailable on current device. |
| **Accessibility & colour contrast**                                             | Low contrast and small fonts make the app unusable for many users and risk legal non-compliance.    | • Run automated contrast testing (e.g., axe) in CI; adjust palette.<br>• Increase base font size to 16 px; ensure labels are programmatically associated with inputs.                                                                                                                                        |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Close any open popover/menu when the user attempts to click the primary modal action (Create Task, Save, etc.) – fixes the hard blocker seen in Drag & Move flow.**
2. **Implement universal success toast + ARIA live region for create / edit / delete / share actions.**
3. **Standardise spacing and button styles via a shared Mui theme – quick CSS work with high perceived polish.**
4. **Spell-check and rewrite key micro-copy (‘tasks’, confirmation messages, menu labels).**
5. **Add contrast checks and adjust colour palette to meet AA standards – small tweak, big accessibility win.**
