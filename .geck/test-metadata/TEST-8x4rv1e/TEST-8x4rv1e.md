## UX Analysis

*UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory.*

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User starts confident seeing dashboard but quickly notices visual rough edges. Successfully opening the modal gives brief reassurance, yet mis-aligned fields feel sloppy. Repeated spacing issues erode trust. Hitting a brick wall when the colour picker is invisible—and an unstable Add-Task button in another flow—creates sharp frustration and prevents goal completion. Because success messages are never reached, the overall sentiment ends in disappointment and low confidence.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Launch dashboard | ✅ pass | All tests begin by opening http://localhost:5173 successfully.; Early UI checks already flag inconsistent button styling and cramped layout. |
| Click “Add Task” on dashboard | ❌ mixed | In three test runs the button is clicked without issue.; In the “Pin a Task” flow the element is reported “not stable” and the click times-out → HARD FAILURE (entire flow blocked). |
| Add-Task modal appears | ✅ pass | Modal opens when the click succeeds.; Automated visual checks repeatedly note mis-aligned labels, uneven spacing and missing ‘Select Categories’ label. |
| Populate Task Name & Description | ✅ pass | Input works but label alignment and font-size inconsistencies persist. |
| Set Deadline | ✅ pass | Date picker works, yet its label is sometimes missing or mis-aligned. |
| Select Categories | ✅ pass | Category combobox works; spacing/padding still called out as cramped. |
| Choose Task colour | ❌ fail | Both “Add a New Task” and “Mark Task as Done” flows cannot locate the colour picker/section → HARD FAILURE, test aborted.; UI checks simultaneously flag brand-inconsistent colours. |
| Pick Emoji (skipped) | ❌ skipped | Because colour step fails, subsequent emoji and ‘Create Task’ actions never run. |
| Create / Verify Task | ❌ pending | Success messages and list updates are untested due to earlier failures. |
| Pin Task flow (blocked early) | ❌ fail | Add-Task button instability stops the scenario; pin-specific steps never execute. |
| Mark Task as Done flow | ❌ fail | Process mirrors add flow but again halts when colour picker is missing. |
| Mark Task as Not Done flow | ❌ running | Currently pending at description/deadline stage; earlier steps mirror same UI concerns. |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area | Why It Matters | Next Actions |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Missing / hidden Colour Picker** | Blocks task creation in multiple flows; users cannot finish primary job. | • Verify component is rendered and visible in modal for all screen sizes.<br>• Add fallback or make colour optional until picker is fixed.<br>• Include automated test to assert its presence. |
| **“Add Task” button stability** | If the main CTA is hard to click, users are stuck at step 1. | • Investigate re-render or animation causing element instability; debounce or remove unnecessary motion.<br>• Increase clickable area and ensure pointer cursor appears. |
| **Label ↔ Input alignment & missing labels** | Mis-aligned or absent labels hurt clarity and accessibility (screen readers, WCAG). | • Adopt grid/flex layout with consistent gap tokens.<br>• Audit all fields for required aria-labels and visible text. |
| **Spacing, padding, and cramped layout** | Dense UI feels overwhelming and reduces readability on smaller screens. | • Define spacing scale in design-tokens; apply via global theme or utility classes.<br>• Run automated visual regression for spacing. |
| **Button style / visual hierarchy inconsistency** | Inconsistent styles weaken brand trust and make CTAs less discoverable. | • Create button component variants (primary, secondary, icon) in design system.<br>• Refactor existing buttons to use these variants. |
| **Colour contrast & brand compliance** | Low contrast impairs accessibility; off-brand colours appear unprofessional. | • Run colour-contrast checks (e.g., WCAG AA).<br>• Update palette tokens; verify in dark/light modes. |
| **Feedback after task creation / status change** | Users need confirmation their action succeeded. | • Ensure toast or inline success message appears and is announced to screen readers.<br>• Add automated assertion for message visibility. |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Restore / expose colour picker or temporarily remove it from required flow so users can finish creating tasks.**
2. **Fix ‘Add Task’ button instability—disable animation on mount, confirm stable DOM before click.**
3. **Standardise form layout: align all labels & inputs, add any missing labels, apply consistent spacing tokens.**
4. **Introduce a single button component style (primary/icon) across dashboard and modal for instant visual cohesion.**
5. **Run automated colour-contrast check and correct any values failing WCAG AA; quick SCSS/Theme token update.**
