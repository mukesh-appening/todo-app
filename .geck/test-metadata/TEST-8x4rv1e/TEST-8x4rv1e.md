## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> A shopper starts confident when the app loads quickly. Opening the modal feels straightforward, but visual inconsistencies create mild doubt. Frustration spikes when the Create-Task button is un-clickable because a dropdown covers it, or a required field is missing. In successful flows, the lack of an obvious success message keeps the user guessing. Overall sentiment: shaky trust → acute frustration → tentative relief (in lucky cases) but lingering sense of clunkiness.

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch & land on dashboard                    | ✅ pass                   | All scenarios open http://localhost:5173 successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Open “Add Task” modal                         | ✅ pass                   | Add-Task FAB/‘+’ button is found and clicked in every run. Modal normally appears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Fill in task details                          | ✅ pass                   | Name, description, deadline and category fields are completed in most runs.; UI-review bot repeatedly flags inconsistent typography, padding and label alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Submit the task (Create Task button)          | ❌ fail                   | TEST-gp6fsae, TEST-u4j7hud – click is repeatedly retried but blocked by the still-open category dropdown. 5-second timeout → HARD FAILURE.; TEST-zlekvij – modal appears mis-structured; Task Name field not found → HARD FAILURE.; Later suites (TEST-y04binn, TEST-8x4rv1e) manage to click Create Task and pass, but screenshots show very long hunting / scrolling before success. |
| Post-creation feedback                        | ❌ mixed                  | Successful runs do not surface a clear toast or inline confirmation—bot must infer success by checking lists or marking a task complete.; Failed runs never reach this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Additional task actions (move, pin, complete) | ❌ mostly pending/partial | Dragging, pinning, category creation scenarios stop early because upstream task-creation fails.; ‘Mark Task as done’ passes but involves many redundant scrolls/clicks before locating controls.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                           | Why It Matters                                                                         | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clickable-area / overlay management**        | Blocked clicks stop users cold and break the core add-task flow.                       | • Automatically close dropdowns/menus when an option is chosen so they no longer intercept clicks.<br>• Add z-index rules so popovers never overlap primary action buttons.<br>• Add E2E test for clicking Create Task immediately after selecting a category. |
| **Field discoverability & alignment in modal** | Users couldn’t find the Task Name field in one run; misaligned labels slow data entry. | • Audit modal DOM order; ensure all inputs render consistently.<br>• Use a vertical Stack/Grid to align labels left and inputs full-width.<br>• Add placeholder & aria-label attributes for robust selectors/accessibility.                                    |
| **Visual hierarchy & typography**              | Inconsistent sizes/weights make it hard to scan forms and lists, eroding brand trust.  | • Define heading, label and body text styles in a theme and apply via tokens.<br>• Run automated linting (stylelint) for font-size deviations.<br>• Pair with design to document type scale.                                                                   |
| **Spacing & padding**                          | Uneven gutters cause visual clutter and accidental taps, especially on touch.          | • Create spacing scale (e.g., 4/8/16/24px) and refactor components to use it.<br>• Add snapshot tests that fail when components drift from spacing rules.                                                                                                      |
| **Color & contrast**                           | Low contrast and off-brand colors hurt accessibility and perceived polish.             | • Run WCAG contrast checks on all text/button combos.<br>• Adopt a palette in a CSS variable file; replace ad-hoc hex codes.<br>• Indicate selected states with both color and iconography.                                                                    |
| **Feedback / confirmations**                   | Users aren’t sure the task was added, leading to duplicate actions or confusion.       | • Display a toast or inline success banner after Create Task succeeds.<br>• Scroll the newly added task into view and briefly highlight it.<br>• Add error handling to show inline messages when submission fails.                                             |
| **Performance of scroll-heavy modals**         | Long scrolls inflate task creation time (observed 40-280 s).                           | • Group advanced options (emoji, color) into an accordion or stepper.<br>• Let primary fields remain above the fold and sticky ‘Create’ button stay visible.                                                                                                   |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix dropdown overlay so it auto-closes or doesn’t obstruct the Create Task button – removes the #1 blocker causing test failures.**
2. **Add an obvious success toast + scroll-into-view highlight for newly created tasks – immediate confidence boost.**
3. **Implement a global typography & spacing scale via the design system – quick CSS tokens bring instant visual consistency.**
4. **Keep the Create Task button sticky at the bottom of the modal – eliminates long scrolling and missed clicks.**
5. **Add aria-labels / test-ids to all form controls – stabilizes automated tests and improves accessibility.**
