## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User starts confident (app loads quickly) → mild irritation (visual polish feels unfinished) → rising friction (long scrolls within modal, dropdown clutter) → major frustration when “Create Task” cannot be clicked (blocked by overlay) → uncertainty (no clear success feedback) → partial relief when later flows succeed → lingering doubt about reliability & visual quality.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch & land on Dashboard                                                  | ✅ pass         | All tests begin by opening http://localhost:5173 without issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Open “Add New Task” modal                                                   | ✅ pass         | User clicks the global “+ / Add Task” button.; Modal appears, but UI review flags inconsistent typography, padding and button styling.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fill out task fields (name, description, deadline, category, colour, emoji) | ✅ pass         | Typing and picker interactions generally work, but many alignment / spacing / contrast issues are recorded.; Colour & category dropdowns are visually noisy.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Submit the task via “Create Task”                                           | ❌ fail         | In the Drag-and-Move scenario the click is blocked by the still-open category pop-over causing a 5 s timeout. This is a hard failure stopping the remainder of that flow.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Observe confirmation / new task in list                                     | ❌ mixed        | Some scenarios show the task appearing; others never surface a toast or list update, leaving testers uncertain if save worked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Additional task actions (complete, move, pin, duplicate, edit, delete)      | ❌ mixed        | Mark done / not-done and pin flows finish but screens lack clear visual state change or snack-bar feedback.; Move (drag-and-drop) never reached because creation failed.; Duplicate & Edit succeed but rely on the same modal with the same UI consistency issues.; Delete flow completes but feedback message/screenshot timing is inconsistent. |
| Settings – Appearance                                                       | ❌ partial      | Dark-mode, theme, glow-effect toggles can be switched, yet several planned assertions remain pending (e.g. Reduce Motion ‘System’).; UI checklist again flags padding/typography issues.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Category management (add / edit / favourite)                                | ❌ not-executed | Corresponding tests never progressed beyond ‘pending’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                               | Why It Matters                                                                                       | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clickable overlays block primary actions**       | A category pop-over intercepting clicks prevents saving a task—core workflow stopper.                | • Auto-close pop-over when a value is chosen or when user clicks outside.<br>• Disable pointer-events for hidden menu layers.<br>• Add e2e test that tries to click “Create Task” immediately after selecting a category. |
| **Lack of success / error feedback**               | Users aren’t sure if actions (save, delete, duplicate) worked; leads to double input or abandonment. | • Show toast/snack-bar with concise copy (e.g. “Task created”) and fade after 2–3 s.<br>• Ensure list auto-scrolls to new/updated task.<br>• Add ARIA live-region for screen-reader parity.                               |
| **Typography, spacing & visual hierarchy**         | Inconsistent fonts and cramped layouts make the UI feel unprofessional and hamper scannability.      | • Establish type scale (e.g. 16/24/32 px) and apply via design tokens.<br>• Use consistent 8-pt spacing grid for padding/margins.<br>• Audit CSS for duplicate ad-hoc font-weight overrides.                              |
| **Button style consistency**                       | Mismatched sizes/colours reduce recognisability and hurt brand perception.                           | • Define primary / secondary / ghost button variants in design system.<br>• Replace ad-hoc class combinations with those tokens.<br>• Run automated visual regression on buttons.                                         |
| **Input label alignment & accessibility contrast** | Misaligned labels and low-contrast colours slow form completion and fail WCAG AA.                    | • Wrap each label+input in flex column or grid.<br>• Run automated a11y check for 4.5:1 contrast.<br>• Adjust theme colours accordingly.                                                                                  |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix category pop-over so it no longer blocks the “Create Task” button (auto-close / z-index).**
2. **Add toast/snack-bar confirmations for create, edit, delete, duplicate actions.**
3. **Create global button component and swap out inconsistent instances.**
4. **Apply consistent 8-pt spacing & type scale to the Add/Edit Task modal (highest screen-time).**
5. **Improve contrast of text vs. background, starting with category pills & settings panel. **
