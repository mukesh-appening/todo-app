## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> User starts confident (app loads quickly) → notices small visual rough edges → feels productive while adding tasks → sudden frustration when Create Task button is blocked by an open menu (hard stop) → recovers after completing basic done/not-done flows → annoyance returns when expected confirmations (toast, icon change, pin reorder) don’t show → overall feeling: the app is functional but fragile and visually inconsistent, leaving users only 70-80 % confident that actions really happened.

### Step-by-Step Narrative

Detailed breakdown of each test step with status and key observations from the UX analysis.

| Step                               | Status             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Launch & first impression       | ✅ pass            | All scenarios start by successfully opening http://localhost:5173.; Early UI review flags inconsistent typography & spacing on the landing view.                                                                                                                               |
| 2. Add-Task flow (core happy-path) | ❌ mixed           | Form opens and can be filled (passed in 3 scenarios).; Repeated UI review warnings: mismatched fonts, cramped padding, button style drift.; Hard failure in Drag-and-Move test – dropdown menu stays open and blocks the “Create Task” button (step 8, locator.click timeout). |
| 3. Drag & move task                | ❌ fail            | Because ‘Create Task’ never fires (blocked click), later drag steps stay pending.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4. Category management             | ❌ fail            | ‘Add New Category’ test never executes beyond pending – feature path untested.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5. Mark task Done / Not-Done       | ❌ partial         | Mark-Done scenario completes, although visual confirmation steps rely on screenshots rather than explicit assertions.; Mark-Not-Done fails at step 6 – no toast / success message surfaced.                                                                                    |
| 6. Pin task                        | ❌ fail            | Flow reaches 93 % but stalls on last step – no pin icon or list re-ordering detected.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 7. View Details & Edit task        | ❌ pass-with-gaps  | Modal appears and fields are editable; however many assertions are inferred (no direct DOM checks).; UI review continues to flag mis-aligned labels, uneven padding, and inconsistent button styles.                                                                           |
| 8. Duplicate task                  | ❌ running/pending | Duplication option clicked, but duplicated item never observed; remaining validation steps pending.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 9. Delete task                     | ✅ pass            | Delete dialog works and task disappears, yet success feedback is visually unclear and screenshots rather than in-app toast confirm the change.                                                                                                                                 |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                           | Why It Matters                                                                                                              | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Popup & overlay behaviour**                                  | Open menus (category dropdown, popover) intercept clicks and block critical buttons, causing task creation to fail.         | • Automatically close dropdowns when user clicks outside or presses ‘Create’.<br>• Raise z-index of primary action buttons or reposition popovers so they never overlap CTAs.<br>• Add E2E test that asserts the Create Task button is clickable after a category is chosen. |
| **Feedback & confirmation patterns**                           | Several flows expect a toast or inline message (create, delete, mark not-done, pin) but none appears, leaving users unsure. | • Implement consistent toast/snackbar system for all CRUD operations.<br>• Include ARIA live-region for accessibility.<br>• Add UI tests that wait for the toast text (e.g., “Task created”).                                                                                |
| **Visual consistency (typography, padding, buttons)**          | Nearly every UI review flags font, spacing, and button inconsistencies – erodes brand polish and readability.               | • Adopt a design-system or CSS utility scale (e.g., 8-pt grid).<br>• Create shared Button, Input, Modal components that enforce size & font.<br>• Run a visual regression test suite (Percy, Chromatic).                                                                     |
| **Color & contrast**                                           | Low contrast for tags and backgrounds affects accessibility and quick scanning.                                             | • Run automated a11y audit (Lighthouse) and adjust palette to meet WCAG AA.<br>• Reserve vibrant brand colors for accents; use neutral backgrounds behind text.                                                                                                              |
| **Robustness of advanced task actions (drag, pin, duplicate)** | Power-user features currently fail or give no visual cue, risking data loss and frustration.                                | • Add loading states & optimistic UI updates (re-ordering instantly reflects).<br>• Ensure icons (pin, drag handle) appear immediately after action.<br>• Instrument analytics to detect failure rate of these actions in production.                                        |

### Priority Action Items

Ranked list of immediate actions to improve the user experience, ordered by impact and feasibility.

1. **Fix dropdown / popover overlap so primary buttons (Create Task) are always clickable.**
2. **Implement universal toast/snackbar for success & error messages (create, edit, delete, pin, duplicate).**
3. **Introduce a shared Button & Input component to unify typography, size, and padding across the app.**
4. **Add automated accessibility & contrast checks to CI pipeline to catch color issues early.**
5. **Add explicit UI/DOM assertions for advanced actions (pin icon appears, task moves) to prevent silent failures.**
