## UX Analysis

_UX analysis data is also available as raw JSON in `ux-analysis.json` in this directory._

### Emotional Journey

This analysis describes the user's emotional experience throughout the test execution, highlighting moments of confidence, frustration, and satisfaction.

> Starts confident on landing page. Slight friction appears during task creation (extra clicks, modal clutter). Frustration spikes when Create Task is blocked by an open dropdown, or when actions (Add Category, Export, Install PWA) silently fail. Confidence partially returns on simple flows (logout) but overall ends with doubt because several advanced features feel unreliable or unfinished.

| Landing on the Dashboard                  | ‚úÖ pass    | Users successfully reach http://localhost:5173 across all tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Creating a New Task                       | ‚ùå mixed   | Most tests proceed through the ‚ÄúAdd Task‚Äù modal, populate fields, and attempt to submit.; Hard failure: in the Drag & Move Task flow, the Categories dropdown stays open and intercepts the pointer, so the ‚ÄúCreate Task‚Äù button never registers (Step 8 ‚Üí fail).     |
| Editing, Completing and Re-ordering Tasks | ‚ùå mixed   | Dragging to reorder never begins (blocked by earlier failure).; Mark-as-done flow works but visual strike-through / feedback is inconsistent and sometimes unobserved.; Edit flow technically passes, but UI shows mis-aligned labels and no clear Save confirmation. |
| Category Management                       | ‚ùå mixed   | Editing & favouriting categories succeed, but ‚ÄòAdd New Category‚Äô with colour Violet fails ‚Äì new category never appears (Steps 7‚Äì8 ‚Üí fail).                                                                                                                            |
| Settings / Appearance                     | ‚ùå partial | Dark-mode toggles work, but some options (e.g., Reduce Motion ‚ÄòSystem‚Äô) remain pending.; Glow effect toggle lacked disable step observation.                                                                                                                          |
| Advanced Share / Export                   | ‚ùå failed  | Share via link passes but toast confirmation often missing.; Share via QR ‚Äì QR rendered but download flow left pending; final screenshot not captured.; Export to Calendar ‚Äì ‚ÄòAdd to Apple Calendar‚Äô button clicks but .ics never downloads (Step 8 ‚Üí fail).          |
| PWA Installation                          | ‚ùå failed  | User cannot find an ‚ÄòInstall App‚Äô prompt; all install-and-launch steps fail.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Qualitative Improvement Opportunities

Identified areas for UX improvement with rationale and actionable next steps.

| Area                                                  | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                            | Next Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction Blocking & Focus Management**           | Hidden overlays (e.g., open dropdowns, popovers) intercept clicks, causing hard-stops that feel like broken buttons.                                      | ‚Ä¢ Automatically close dropdown menus on outside click or when modal primary action is attempted.<br>‚Ä¢ Add z-index & pointer-events tests in CI to catch future regressions.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide inline error or shake animation when primary action is blocked.                               |
| **Visual Consistency (Typography, Padding, Buttons)** | Nearly every UI review flags mismatched fonts, margins, and button styles; this erodes perceived quality and brand trust.                                 | ‚Ä¢ Adopt a global design-token system (spacing, font sizes, button variants).<br>‚Ä¢ Audit all MUI component overrides; ensure one source of truth.<br>‚Ä¢ Run an automated visual regression tool (e.g., Chromatic) on every PR.                                                           |
| **Feedback & Confirmation Messages**                  | Users often do not know if an action succeeded (task added, category favourited, link copied). Absence of toasts or in-place updates creates uncertainty. | ‚Ä¢ Add toast/snackbar for all CRUD actions (created, updated, deleted, shared).<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure visual states (strike-through, star fill) update immediately after action resolves.<br>‚Ä¢ Include success/error aria-live regions for accessibility.                                         |
| **Export / Download Flows (.ics, QR, PWA)**           | Advanced features are broken; users investing time to integrate with calendars or share tasks hit dead-ends ‚Üí churn risk.                                 | ‚Ä¢ Debug calendar export endpoint; ensure proper ‚ÄòContent-Disposition: attachment‚Äô header.<br>‚Ä¢ Make ‚ÄúDownload QR‚Äù a direct link with correct Blob/Object-URL fallback.<br>‚Ä¢ Add PWA manifest + service-worker ‚Äòbeforeinstallprompt‚Äô handler; surface install button in header toolbar. |
| **Accessibility & Color Contrast**                    | Low contrast colors and small fonts exclude users and fail WCAG; also mentioned repeatedly by UI reviews.                                                 | ‚Ä¢ Run automated a11y audit (axe) and fix < AA issues.<br>‚Ä¢ Provide theme color ramp with guaranteed contrast ratios.<br>‚Ä¢ Enforce min font-size via style-lint rules.                                                                                                                  |

### Priority Action Items

3. **Standardise typography, spacing and button variants using a shared design-token file.**
4. **Ensure calendar export endpoint returns a valid .ics download; smoke-test via automated test.**
5. **Surface a clear, always-visible PWA install button and register ‚Äòbeforeinstallprompt‚Äô to improve discoverability.**
